# closest_step
Pulls the results from each optimisation of a Gaussian output file (.log) and prints the step with the closest values to the optimisation thresholds.

# convergence_cli
Pulls the results from each optimisation of a Gaussian output file (.log) and graphs the values against their converging criteria in plots which are printed to the command-line.

# convergence_interactive
Pulls the results from each optimisation of a Gaussian output file (.log) and graphs the values against their converging criteria in an interactive plot.
